# Adarsh Anil Kumar - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
My name is Adarsh Anil Kumar. I am a postgraduate student bound to completing an MSc. degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a great interest in solving questions through the cultivation of an analytical mind. Such a mindset has awakened my passion for answering questions and uncovering relevant insights.<br><br>
Through my introduction to the concept of Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program provided by Coursera, it had given me the necessary push to pursue higher studies pertaining to the same concept. During my higher studies, I was exposed to the deeper technical aspects behind Data Analytics, introducing me to various methodologies and technologies that are relevant for the current industry standards.<br><br>
I was able to develop my technical skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **Microsoft Excel** and **Microsoft Power BI** alongside various tools and software including the likes of **Visual Studio Code**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Microsoft SQL Server** and **Google Colab**. Such accomplishments was made possible through various university assignments and personal projects. Such projects raised my skills in statistical data analysis, data transformations, probability distributions and data visualization. In an attempt to stand out from other data analyst aspirants, I had made an effort to dabble with data engineering concepts and focus more on **ETL pipelines** whilst utilizing technologies such as **Amazon S3** and **Snowflake** data warehousing tool.<br><br>
I take delight in taking on new projects to reinforce the skills that I have learned while learning new skills at the same time. While, most of the projects I have undertaken, had been independent, I am rather excited to work as a part of a team to understand the perspective of other gifted people and learn from the experienced while imparting my knowledge when applicable.<br><br> 
This is a space I have created to showcase my talent and knowledge through personal work while picking up on mistakes made prior to help publish more higher quality projects in the future.<br><br>

## Personal Projects
- **Cloud-based Static ETL Taxi Data Pipeline with Power BI Reporting**<br><br>
  - Data: TLC Yellow Taxi Trip Record Data [[Source](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)]<br><br>
  - Dimensions: Yellow Taxi Trip Records (20 Columns | 3.3 Million Rows); Taxi Zone Lookup Table (4 Columns | 266 Rows)<br><br>
  - Goal: To suggest effective decision making that may reduce the likelihood of a taxi trip fare getting refunded through an analysis of trends regarding refunded trips and trip disputes.<br><br>
  - Purpose: To provide a set of effective decisions over which taxi companies could act upon to reduce the chance of a taxi trip fare getting refunded.<br><br>
  - Skills Portrayed: Data Extraction, Data File Type Conversion, Cloud Storage, Data Warehousing, SQL Queries, SQL Table Joins, SQL Common Table Expressions, SQL Data Manipulation, SQL Data Cleaning, SQL Feature Engineering, BI Data Visualization, DAX Queries, Insight Reflection<br><br>
  - Technology: Jupyter Notebooks, Amazon S3, Snowflake and Power BI<br><br>
  - Result: **Found JFK Airport pickup trips and trips to outside New York City to be the main source of trip disputes and refunded trip fares.**<br><br>

- **Segment-based Factor Analysis with ML Regression & XAI Implementation**<br><br>
  - Data: 2010 New York Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data [[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/2010-new-york-state-hospital-inpatient-discharge)]<br><br>
  - Dimensions: 38 Columns | 2.62 Million Rows<br><br>
  - Goal: To analyze the difference between significant factors affecting a patient's Length of Stay (LoS) in hospitals between Elective and Emergency Admission records, in an attempt to understand which factors should be focused on for both admission types to better optimize LoS and smoothen the workflow.<br><br>
  - Purpose: To emphasize clinical decision making, which in turn can help address on how to better handle and optimize LoS for patients coming under both admission types.<br><br>
  - Skills Portrayed: Python Programming, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Correlation, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, Cross-Validation, Explainable AI, Insight Reflection<br><br>
  - Technology: Python<br><br>
    - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Category Encoders, Statsmodels, XGBoost, Tensorflow, Numpy, SHAP<br><br>
  - Software Used: Google Colab<br><br>
  - Result: **Found inconsistencies between feature importance rankings of both admission types with Hospital Operational Charges and Patient Bills being the top 2 consistently significant factors affecting LoS for both types while Surgeries for patients under Elective Admission is more significant compared to those under Emergency Admission circumstances.**<br><br>
  - Action upon Results: **Made seperate suggestions for both Admission based on most significant factors to help better optimize LoS for patients under both admission types and smoothen the workflow.**<br><br>
